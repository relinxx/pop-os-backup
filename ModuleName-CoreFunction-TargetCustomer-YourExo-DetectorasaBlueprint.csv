"1. Orbital-Track","Space Situational Awareness (SSA): Detects and predicts anomalous behavior in Earth-orbiting objects (satellites, debris). Flags potential collisions, unexpected maneuvers, or signs of malfunction.","Satellite Operators (SpaceX, OneWeb), Governments (Space Force, ESA), Insurance Companies.","This is a direct commercial application of your core technology. Instead of analyzing starlight time-series for dips (transits), it analyzes satellite positional/brightness data for deviations from expected orbits. The AI engine is the same."
"2. Exo-Scout","Scientific Discovery & Data Sourcing: Uses idle compute and refined algorithms to analyze deep space data for scientific targets like exoplanets, variable stars, and asteroids.","Research Institutions, Universities, Citizen Scientists.","This is yourExo-Detectorproject, integrated directly. It serves as a powerful R&D testbed, a PR tool (public discoveries), and a way to refine algorithms on non-critical data."
"3. Terra-Sight","https://tactyqal.com/blog/15-startup-ideas-in-space-tech/","Agriculture Tech, Hedge Funds, Environmental Agencies, Insurance.","This diversifies the company's revenue streams beyond SSA and leverages a multi-billion dollar market."
"4. Edge-AI","https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/ai-solutions-for-space-industry/","Satellite Manufacturers, Deep Space Missions.","This is the long-term, high-tech vision. It transitions the company from a data analysis provider to a core technology licensor for next-generation autonomous spacecraft."
