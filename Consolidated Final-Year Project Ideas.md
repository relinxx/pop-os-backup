# Consolidated Final-Year Project Ideas

This document outlines a refined list of innovative Final-Year Project (FYP) ideas, each addressing a significant real-world problem through novel AI-powered software solutions. Redundant ideas from the initial prompt and uploaded attachments have been merged and clarified. For each idea, we detail the unsolved problem, the innovative software solution, its core AI integration, and the relevant research context, along with technical and non-technical requirements.

## 1. AI-Driven Early Warning System for Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks

*   **Unsolved Problem:** The current global health landscape lacks a truly integrated, real-time early warning system for zoonotic disease outbreaks. Existing methods rely on fragmented data and slow manual reporting, leading to delayed responses and increased risk of widespread crises. The challenge lies in fusing diverse data sources and identifying subtle patterns indicative of an emerging threat.

*   **Innovative Software Solution:** Develop an AI platform that aggregates and analyzes real-time, multi-source data to predict potential zoonotic disease outbreaks. This platform would ingest data from veterinary records, wildlife sensor networks, environmental monitoring systems, and public health reports (including social media and news feeds). The system would use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from unstructured text, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model complex relationships between hosts, pathogens, and environmental factors. The AI would identify unusual patterns, anomalies, and correlations that precede outbreaks, issuing timely and actionable alerts to public health authorities. A web-based dashboard would visualize risk areas, predicted spread, and key indicators.

*   **AI Integration:**
    *   **Data Fusion:** AI algorithms (e.g., deep learning, ensemble methods) to integrate heterogeneous data streams (structured and unstructured).

## 2. AI-Powered Microplastic Detection and Analysis in Water Bodies

*   **Unsolved Problem:** The pervasive issue of microplastic pollution in aquatic environments (oceans, rivers, lakes, drinking water) is severely hampered by the lack of efficient, real-time, and cost-effective detection and quantification methods. Current laboratory-based analyses are slow, expensive, and cannot provide the spatial and temporal resolution needed to understand pollution dynamics and identify hotspots.

*   **Innovative Software Solution:** An AI-powered system designed for autonomous, in-situ detection and classification of microplastics in water bodies. The core of the solution involves a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of underwater images containing various types, sizes, and colors of microplastics. This CNN would be integrated with an imaging system (e.g., mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) or a fixed buoy). The software would process the imagery in real-time, identify microplastic particles, classify them by type (e.g., fiber, fragment, pellet), and quantify their presence. The data would then be transmitted to a central platform, generating a live, interactive map of microplastic distribution, identifying pollution sources, and tracking their movement over time.

The AI would then dynamically generate and deliver tailored interventions, such as guided meditations, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises, mindfulness prompts, or even personalized conversational support, adapting to the user's current emotional state and historical responses. The system would operate largely autonomously, with a secure, asynchronous communication channel to human mental health professionals for oversight and intervention in critical situations.

## 4. AI-Driven Urban Heat Island Prediction and Mitigation Planner

*   **Unsolved Problem:** Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) significantly impact urban quality of life, energy consumption, and public health, yet city planners lack dynamic, predictive, and actionable tools to effectively mitigate them. Current approaches often rely on static models or general guidelines, failing to account for real-time urban dynamics and the complex interplay of environmental factors.

*   **Innovative Software Solution:** A web-based AI tool that provides real-time prediction of UHI formation and offers dynamic, optimized mitigation strategies. The system would integrate diverse data sources including satellite imagery (Land Surface Temperature, vegetation indices), local weather station data, urban infrastructure data (building materials, road networks), and demographic information. Using advanced machine learning models (e.g., deep learning for image analysis, time-series models for temperature prediction), the AI would predict UHI hotspots and their intensity. Crucially, the platform would feature a generative AI component that simulates the impact of various mitigation interventions (e.g., increased green spaces, cool roofs, permeable pavements) on urban temperatures. This allows city planners to run 


‘what-if’ scenarios, visualize the projected cooling effects, and receive optimized recommendations for intervention placement and type. The platform would also track the effectiveness of implemented strategies over time.

*   **Innovative Software Solution:** An AI-powered adaptive learning and cognitive support application that continuously monitors a patient's cognitive performance, emotional state, and daily context, and dynamically adjusts therapeutic exercises and cognitive aids. The system would use multimodal input, including user interactions within the app (e.g., response times, accuracy in cognitive games), speech analysis (for fluency, word retrieval), and potentially sensor data from wearables (e.g., activity levels, sleep patterns). Through reinforcement learning, the AI would personalize the difficulty, type, and presentation of cognitive exercises in real-time, ensuring optimal challenge without causing frustration. It would also provide personalized feedback, gentle reminders, and adaptive prompts for daily tasks.

The system would ingest and analyze incoming reports from various sources, including social media (text, images, videos), emergency calls, sensor data (e.g., seismic, weather, drone footage), and official agency updates. Using advanced NLP, computer vision, and audio analysis, the AI would automatically extract critical information (e.g., location of victims, type of damage, resource needs), prioritize urgent requests, and identify emerging patterns. The platform would then use optimization algorithms to recommend optimal resource allocation (e.g., deployment of rescue teams, medical supplies, food), identify efficient routes, and coordinate actions among different response agencies (e.g., fire, police, medical, NGOs). A real-time, interactive dashboard would provide a unified operational picture, allowing commanders to make data-driven decisions and track the status of ongoing operations.

*   **Innovative Software Solution:** An AI-centric dashboard and simulation tool that processes diverse space surveillance data to predict debris trajectories with unprecedented accuracy and facilitate collision avoidance. The system would ingest data from ground-based radar, optical telescopes, and potentially in-orbit sensors. The core AI would leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the complex gravitational and atmospheric drag forces affecting debris, even with incomplete datasets. It would also employ advanced time-series forecasting models to predict chaotic debris paths. The dashboard would provide space agencies with a real-time, interactive visualization of orbital debris, highlight potential collision risks, and allow mission planners to simulate avoidance maneuvers for active spacecraft.

The system would use multimodal AI (integrating voice analysis, eye-tracking, keyboard/mouse interaction patterns, and potentially wearable sensor data) to infer a user's cognitive state, engagement level, and specific learning challenges in real-time. The AI would then dynamically adjust the presentation format (e.g., visual vs. auditory, text complexity), content difficulty, pace, and feedback mechanisms. For example, it could detect signs of sensory overload and offer calming exercises, or identify attention drift and introduce interactive elements. The platform would also incorporate elements to support executive functions, social-emotional learning, and communication skills, all adapted to the individual's profile. A hybrid web interface would allow educators, therapists, or parents to monitor progress, set goals, and provide high-level input, while the AI manages the micro-adaptations.
